            Our guide, Emre, was fantastic! He shared so many hidden details
            about the Hagia Sophia that I would have never noticed on my own.
            Walking through the Grand Bazaar was such a unique experience - I
            even got to try some freshly made Turkish delight at a tiny shop
            tucked away in one of the quieter corners. Definitely an
            unforgettable experience.

            This tour had such a great energy! The boat ride on the Bosphorus at
            sunset was stunning, and the way the city lights reflected on the
            water was unreal. At the Spice Market, I found a tiny shop selling
            saffron and the freshest pistachios Iâ€™ve ever had. I also met Jake
            from Australia during the tour, and we ended up exploring more of
            Istanbul together the next day - still friends to this day! A truly
            special experience.
